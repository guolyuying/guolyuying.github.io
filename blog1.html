                <p>I moved back home recently after being away for five years and discovered the college offers dating back to 2017 that are still lying on my high school study desk.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Those admission packets were the highest honor for me as a high school student. I saw them as the symbol of my 18-year life’s achievement. The scholarships, $20,000 per year; the big names, NYU, USC… Before I received those honors, I thought my life would be doomed — I’d be somehow “lower” than my peers who had those things. Although no one needs all these names and titles to finish a college degree, owning them, however, as Chinese people like to say, “Gives me face when I say it out loud.”</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Five years later, flipping through those offer papers again, they felt shockingly light in my hands. I remember I hugged my mom and cried out loud with a shaking voice when I got into USC—the school I ended up choosing—just like those college admission reaction videos on YouTube. The 18-year-old me used to live vicariously through those kids in the videos; but this time, I’m not even able to relive my own excitement by physically holding my own offers. They’re literally expired.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Having graduated from USC, still being the same person that I was, I realized none of those big names mattered as much as I thought. I would still do the things I do had I chosen a less selective, lower-ranked school. I’d still be drawing. I’d still be running towards my creative goals. I’d still be looking for a job. I’d still be lost sometimes. USC didn’t magically solve the problems I came in with, nor did it bestow upon me the positive qualities I already possessed.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Offers expire, other people’s praises expire, my “face” expires. There are other things that don’t.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>What do I spend the rest of my life on after school ends? How do I schedule the 24 hours in a day, for 70 more years? When to get up, how to feed myself, what to work on during an 8-hour workday, how to care for my loved ones… These are the concrete building blocks of one’s lifetime. These questions cannot be answered by a big-name school, a 4.0 GPA, or even a big-name company on a LinkedIn page.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>It was more relieving than disappointing to come to this realization. My life is in my own hands now. In fact, it has always been.</p>
